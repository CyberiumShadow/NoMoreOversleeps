# NoMoreOversleeps #

NoMoreOversleeps is a very simple cross-platform Java application which is designed to help you adapt to a new polyphasic sleeping schedule by preventing you from oversleeping.
Currently it does this by zapping your Pavlok if the mouse on your computer hasn't been moved within a certain time interval (in case you fell asleep or failed to wake up on time).
You can pause it while you're intentionally doing other stuff, e.g. if you're going shopping or going to work and thus you will be AFK for a while.

At the moment it has no other features.

### Features that might be added in the future ###

It would be nice to turn this into a general tool to help people adapt to and track their sleeping schedules. On that basis there are lots of good possibilites. Some ideas I've had include:

* Input your sleeping pattern so you don't have to manually pause during this period
* Tracking function so you can record your sleeping (and possible oversleeping) along with how good each sleep/nap felt
* Play sound or music out of your computer speaker as a backup alarm if you fail to wake up
* Make a phone call or send text message if you fail to wake up
* Send a message to the polysleeping Discord if you fail to wake up so that you can be really embarrased for being such a huge failure
* Food tracker so you can monitor what you're eating in case this affects your sleep schedule
* Productivity tracker so you can input what you're doing in each sleep block to avoid wasting time

I probably won't implement any of these, but we will see.
